b.    var command = "create-students 1 [" + 
      ' set socketid "' + data.socketId + 
      '" setup-student-vars ]';
c.    command = 'ask students with [socketid = "' + turtleSocketId + '" ] [die]'
d.    command = 'ask students with [socketid = "' + turtleSocketId + '" ]' + 
      ' [' +
        ' set used-shape-colors remove my-code used-shape-colors ' +
        ' set-unique-shape-and-color ' +
        ' if infected ' +
        ' [ set-sick-shape ] ' +
      ']';
